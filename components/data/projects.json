        "description": "Millimeter wave technology, commonly known as mmWave, is a vital enabler of the next generation of last-hop communications for mobile devices, with the potential to offer ultra-high-speed wireless communications. These advancements have enabled a range of new applications that employ Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) to create numerous promising applications in various fields such as entertainment, education, and healthcare. However, current congestion control protocols are predominantly throughput-oriented and not suitable for handling the strict low-latency and high-throughput requirements imposed by many of the forthcoming new applications. We propose a new delay-based tunable approach to congestion control that relies on looking ahead in time to better control the sending rate while maintaining low latency, making it suitable for AR/VR applications.",

        "description": "Over 2.6 billion people remain without access to the Internet in 2025. This disparity is most pronounced in developing regions, with affordability being the primary barrier. Existing solutions like satellite internet (Starlink) and high-altitude networks (Aquila, Loon) are costly and difficult to scale, making them impractical for low-resource areas. We introduce SONIC, a novel connectivity solution that leverages FM radio infrastructure—already covering 70% of the world’s population—to deliver simplified webpages. SONIC exploits the broadcast nature of the radio network, utilizing highly avail- able unused frequencies, to reach long distances. SONIC compresses webpages into images, encodes them to audio signals, and transmits via FM stations. Mobile devices running the SONIC app decode these signals to reconstruct webpages. SONIC also enables Large Language Model (LLM) interactions, transmitting text-based responses",

        "description": "The rapid evolution of the next generation of mobile networks has paved the path for the development of a wide array of exciting new applications. Instead of gradual and incremental enhancements, each new generation of mobile networks is improving the capabilities of cellular networks tenfold, with 5G typically being 10 times faster than 4G, and 6G anticipated to be an improvement over 5G with an even higher factor. With these rapid exponential improvements, it is important to ensure that all layers of the network stack are able to keep up and support the performance improvements that are available with these new technologies. However, we still lack a clear understanding of the performance characteristics of current state-of-the-art Congestion Control Algorithms (CCA) in 5G environments with high channel fluctuations over short time scales. We conduct an in-depth analysis of 10 CCAs across various 5G environments, including recently proposed and conventional ones, revealing several interesting results.",

        "description": "The World Wide Web (WWW) empowers people in developing regions by eradicating illiteracy, supporting women, and generating economic opportunities. However, their reliance on limited bandwidth and low-end phones leaves them with a poorer browsing experience compared to privileged users across the digital divide. To evaluate the extent of this phenomenon, we sent participants to 56 cities to measure the cost of mobile data and the average page load time. We found the cost to be orders of magnitude greater, and the average page load time to be four times slower, in some locations compared to others. Addressing this digital inequality through new infrastructure takes years to complete and billions of dollars to finance. A more practical solution is to make the webpages more accessible by reducing their size and optimizing their load time. To this end, we developed a solution called Lite-Web and evaluated it in the Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan, demonstrating that it transforms the browsing experience of a Pakistani villager using a low-end phone to almost that of a Dubai resident using a flagship phone.",

        "description": "The emergence of large language models has led to the development of powerful tools such as ChatGPT that can produce text indistinguishable from human-generated work. With the increasing accessibility of such technology, students across the globe may utilize it to help with their school work—a possibility that has sparked ample discussion on the integrity of student evaluation processes in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). To date, it is unclear how such tools perform compared to students on university-level courses across various disciplines. Further, students’ perspectives regarding the use of such tools in school work, and educators’ perspectives on treating their use as plagiarism, remain unknown. Here, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art tool, ChatGPT, against that of students on 32 university-level courses. We also assess the degree to which its use can be detected by two classifiers designed specifically for this purpose. Additionally, we conduct a global survey across five countries, as well as a more in-depth survey at the authors’ institution, to discern students’ and educators’ perceptions of ChatGPT’s use in school work. We find that ChatGPT’s performance is comparable, if not superior, to that of students in a multitude of courses. Moreover, current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT’s use in school work, due to both their propensity to classify human-written answers as AI-generated, as well as the relative ease with which AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection. Finally, there seems to be an emerging consensus among students to use the tool, and among educators to treat its use as plagiarism. Our findings offer insights that could guide policy discussions addressing the integration of artificial intelligence into educational frameworks.",

These high-demand services rely on data centers, which consume significant amounts of electricity. The resulting carbon emissions from these data centers threaten to exacerbate the climate crisis. Unfortunately, in their current state, it is challenging to rely solely on renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar energy to support these energy demands in an economically feasible manner. New policies are being implemented to reduce carbon emissions, prompting the need for sustainable design in new systems, such as data centers for AI computation. To satisfy these policy requirements and mitigate carbon emissions, any new system must prioritize sustainability. This project aims to develop a system to assess the economic feasibility of sustainable computing within AI services. The simulator will model interactions between key stakeholders and evaluate the environmental and economic impact of sustainability policies.",
